# Deep into Computer Science publications

# Abstract  
Our prject consists of analyzing the scene of computer science publications, its main journals and influential authors.  
The dataset that will be used is the [citation network dataset](https://aminer.org/citation), which contains citation data that is extracted from DBLP and ACM. We especially target the [DBLP-Citation-network V10](https://static.aminer.org/lab-datasets/citation/dblp.v10.zip) that include 3,079,007 papers and 25,166,994 citation relationships from 2010 to 2017 in a JSON-format.  
Through this work, we aim to highlight the major actors of the scientific publications scene over time and show the different social interactions within the network. Moreover, we want to inspect the tendency of co-authoring again with previous collaborators in order to learn more about the collaboration behavior of researchers such as the capacity of an author to collaborate with other colleagues that are new to the research field.  
What motivate us the most is the opportunity that we have to get deep insights on the publications in the computer science field and to see if clich√©s like needed connections to co-author with well-recognized researchers still hold in the course of the project   


# Research questions
* What are the most cited authors ?
* Which journal has the most papers ?
* In how many journals do authors publish averagely? 
* Determine the number of collaboration between two authors ?
* Analyze author affliation(university)?

# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.  
*  Data collection: try to add useful informations about the authors such as affliated university
*  Data cleaning: 

# Questions for TAa
* Is it possible to use a ready python-module such as scholar.py to extract additional informations from Google Scholar about authors?
