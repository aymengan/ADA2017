# Deep into Computer Science publications

# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?  
Our prject consists of analyzing the scene of computer science publications, its main journals and influential authors.  
The dataset that will be used is the [citation network dataset](https://aminer.org/citation), which contains citation data that is extracted from DBLP and ACM. We especially target the [DBLP-Citation-network V10](https://static.aminer.org/lab-datasets/citation/dblp.v10.zip) that include 3,079,007 papers and 25,166,994 citation relationships in a JSON-format.  
Through this work, we aim to highlight the major actors of the scientific publications scene over time and show the different social interactions within the network. Moreover, we want to inspect the tendency of co-authoring again with previous collaborators in order to learn more about the collaboration behavior of researchers such as the capacity of an author to collaborate with other colleagues that are new to the research field.  
What motivate us the most is the opportunity that we have to get deep insights on the publications in the computer science field and to see if clich√©s like needed connections to co-author with well-recognized researchers still hold in the course of the project
